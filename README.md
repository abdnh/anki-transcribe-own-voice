# Transcribe Own Voice

This Anki add-on hooks into Anki's Record Own Voice feature to transcribe your recordings. Transcription depends on the [Speech Recognition for Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/411601849) add-on so you need that installed too for this add-on to be useful.

When you click on the Record Own Voice action in the review screen, the add-on will take your recording, transcribe it using the Speech Recognition add-on and show the text to you in a small window.

You can configure the ASR service used and language from the config.
